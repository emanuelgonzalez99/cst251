		<p>My name is Emanuel Gonzalez. Im a new Communication
Design transfer this fall 2020 semester. I transfered
from Gavilan College in Gilroy, CA and currently live in Hollister, CA.
I have no idea what im doing since I am completely new to coding but
I love creating and have always wanted to createa visually appealing
website, and hopefully this class will help me build the
foundation that I need to do that. I love all forms of art.
I've dabbled in painting, drawing, sculpture, photography,
costume design, and also some performing arts. My favorite thing
to do is hangout with friends; either at a beach or on a hike,
I love the outdoors but also enjoy passimg the time by
watching anime and playing video games with online friends.</p>
