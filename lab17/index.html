	  <h3>Challenges</h3>
	  <p> The goal of this lab assignment is to successfully use "fancy" CSS on

		<h4>Problems</h4>
		<p>In this lab assignment was rather easy to complete but I did struggle width
			some effects not showing up but after going through and fixing small errors
			it was good.</p>

		<h5>Results</h5>
			<p>Both my partner and I successfully accomplished the lab assignment
				and learned about more advanced styling text elements.</p>
