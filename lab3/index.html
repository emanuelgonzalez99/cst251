	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p> The idea of this lab was to further create a local file Structure
		on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>It was pretty easy to do the only challenges were figuring out how Atom
			works since I am new to it. I also did slightly struggle with linking the
			image in the index.html, but after a little back and forth I figured it
			out and now it makes sense.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I successfully accomplished the Lab assignment and learned what the
				Lab was meant to teach me.</p>
