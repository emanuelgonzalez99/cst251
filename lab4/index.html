	<h1>Lab 4 File Transfer</h1>
	<p> The goal of this lab assignment was to pracite our new HTML skills
		to edit our website and to be able to successfully upload it to Github.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>It was pretty easy to do the only challenges were figuring out that
			the instuctions on ILearn are a bit outdated and that I needed to pay
			attention to the zoom meeting and trust that I knew what I was doing.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I successfully accomplished the Lab assignment and learned what the
				Lab was meant to teach me.</p>
