	<h1>Lab 5 More HTML</h1>
	<p> The goal of this lab assignment was to further pracite our HTML skills
		much like other past lab assignments, by adding images and links to other
		websites and to locally test the document and upload it to Github.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>This assignment was pretty easy to do the only challenges were figuring
			out how to add links to the document since I had never done it before
		but after attempting and some back and forth I got it down easily.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I successfully accomplished the Lab assignment and learned what the
				lab assignment was supposed to teach me.</p>
