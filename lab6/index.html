	  <h1>Lab 6 More Complicated HTML</h1>
    <img src="img/selfimage.jpg" width="400">
	  <p> The goal of this lab assignment was to add an image to our HTML document,
make a form, and add/link a CSS file. After this we are to test our files
locally then upload.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>After reading the instructions on Ilearn I was a bit intimidated by some
of the new content we were learning and using on this Lab assignment but
after our class session I felt a bit more at ease and remembered that I could
always ask for help if I need it. Ultimately I didn't struggle very much I just
took a while to complete the assignment which I think was just the learning
curve. </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I successfully accomplished the lab assignment although there were a
				couple of struggles along the way, in the end I learned what the Lab
				was meant to teach me.</p>
