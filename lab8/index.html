	  <h1>Lab 7 Intro to CSS</h1>
	  <p> The goal of this lab assignment is to get introduced into CSS and how it
		works in further customizing a web page.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The lab assignment was pretty straight forward the begining was the same
			as all the ther labs we have done thus far the only difference was the CSS
			but since we sort of explored it a bit in the previous lab it was easy enough
			to grasp and complete. </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I successfully accomplished the lab assignment and learned a bit more
				about CSS while getting through the lecture and lab..</p>
