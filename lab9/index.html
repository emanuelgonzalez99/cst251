	  <h1>Lab 8 CSS Selectors</h1>
	  <p> The goal of this lab assignment is to successfully use css to style
		block elements</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The lab assignment branches off of the last lab so it was a familiar concept
			therefore it wasnt too difficult to complete. </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I successfully accomplished the lab assignment and learned a bit more
				about CSS while getting through the lecture and lab.</p>
